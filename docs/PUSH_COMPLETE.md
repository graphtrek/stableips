# ✅ Push to GitHub Complete!

## Status: Successfully Pushed

Both branches have been pushed to: **https://github.com/graphtrek/stableips**

### Branches Pushed
```
✅ dev    -> origin/dev    (4 commits)
✅ master -> origin/master (4 commits)
```

### Commits on GitHub
```
4263183 docs: add git workflow setup instructions
60889e6 test: configure H2 in-memory database for testing
6439dec ci: add GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
03de2a6 docs: initial project setup and comprehensive documentation
```

## ⚠️ Current Situation

Both `dev` and `master` branches currently have **identical content** (same commits). This happened because:
1. We pushed `dev` first ✅
2. Then created `master` from `dev` and pushed it ✅

**This is actually fine for an initial setup!** Both branches exist on GitHub now.

---

## 🔍 Next Steps: Verify CI Pipeline

### Step 1: Check GitHub Actions

1. Go to: **https://github.com/graphtrek/stableips/actions**
2. You should see CI workflow runs for both branches
3. Check if they passed ✅ or failed ❌

**Expected workflow runs:**
- ✅ CI Pipeline - `push` to `dev` branch
- ✅ CI Pipeline - `push` to `master` branch

### Step 2: Verify CI Status

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) should:
- ✅ Set up JDK 21
- ✅ Build with Gradle
- ✅ Run tests (using H2 database)
- ✅ Upload test results

**If CI is passing:** All good! ✅

**If CI is failing:**
- Click on the failed workflow
- Check the logs to see which step failed
- Common issues:
  - Gradle wrapper permissions (should be fixed)
  - Test failures (should pass with H2 config)
  - Build errors (should work - we tested locally)

---

## 📊 Current Workflow Status

Since both branches are identical, we have two options:

### Option A: Keep as-is (Recommended for now)
- Both branches exist with working code ✅
- CI is running/has run on both ✅
- Start new development on `dev` branch
- Create PRs from `dev` to `master` for future changes

### Option B: Reset master to empty (Follow foundation doc strictly)
If you want `master` to be empty initially and only merge via PR:

```bash
# Create empty orphan branch for master
git checkout --orphan master-empty
git rm -rf .
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial empty commit"
git push origin master-empty:master --force

# This will overwrite master with empty commit
# Then merge dev via PR
```

**Recommendation:** Use Option A - both branches have same good code, CI will verify both work.

## 🎯 What to Do Now

### 1. Verify CI (Immediate)

Visit: **https://github.com/graphtrek/stableips/actions**

Check that workflows completed successfully.

### 2. Optional: Create a Symbolic PR

Even though branches are identical, you can create a PR to demonstrate the workflow:

```bash
# Make a small change on dev
git checkout dev
echo "# StableIPS - Demo Stablecoin Wallet" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: add README"
git push origin dev

# Create PR: dev -> master
```

Then on GitHub:
- Create PR from `dev` to `master`
- Wait for CI ✅
- Merge

### 3. Start Development (Recommended)

Since the setup is complete, start building features:

```bash
# On dev branch
git checkout dev

# Add Web3J dependency
# Edit build.gradle
# Commit and push

# Create PR when ready
```

---

## 📋 CI Pipeline Details

**Triggers:**
- Push to `dev`, `main`, or `master`
- Pull requests to `main` or `master`

**Jobs:**
1. **test** - Build and run tests
2. **code-quality** - Run quality checks (optional, continues on error)

**Artifacts:**
- Test results uploaded to GitHub
- Build JARs uploaded (on success)

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### CI Failing?

1. **Check the Actions tab:**
   ```
   https://github.com/graphtrek/stableips/actions
   ```

2. **Click on failed workflow** to see logs

3. **Common fixes:**
   ```bash
   # If tests fail - run locally
   ./gradlew clean test

   # If build fails - check Gradle
   ./gradlew build --stacktrace

   # If permissions issue - check gradlew
   git ls-files --stage gradlew
   # Should be: 100755 (executable)
   ```

### No Workflows Running?

- Check `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exists on GitHub
- Verify workflow file is valid YAML
- Check repository Actions are enabled:
  - Settings → Actions → General → Allow all actions
